# Data Folder

This folder contains the datasets used in the SQL Query Generation project. Below are the descriptions of the files contained within this directory:

- `training_data.csv`: This file contains the training dataset consisting of natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries. It is used to train the machine learning model to translate questions into SQL.
  
- `test_data.csv`: This file includes the test dataset used to evaluate the model's performance. It consists of a separate set of questions and SQL queries that were not used during the training phase.

These datasets are derived from the larger WikiSQL dataset and have been tailored to demonstrate the model's capabilities on a manageable scale for computation on standard hardware.
