# Results Folder

This folder holds the outputs from the SQL Query Generation project. It includes various checkpoints and the final model parameters after training. Here is a brief description of its contents:

- `checkpoint-50`: Contains model parameters saved after 50 training steps.
- `checkpoint-100`: Contains model parameters saved after 100 training steps.
- `final_model`: Stores the final version of the model after the complete training process.
- `my_model`: A user-defined checkpoint for the model, potentially for personal or specific checkpoints of interest.
- `tmp-checkpoint-50`: A temporary checkpoint created during training, usually for internal use by the training framework.

Each subfolder contains the necessary model files, including configuration, weights, and tokenizer files, to resume training or perform inference as required.
