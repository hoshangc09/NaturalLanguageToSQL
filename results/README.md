# Checkpoint-50 Contents

This folder contains various configuration and model files for the `checkpoint-50` of the SQL Query Generation project.

## Files Description

- `added_tokens.json`: Contains additional tokens that may have been added during tokenization.
- `config.json`: The model's configuration file with settings and hyperparameters.
- `generation_config.json`: Configuration settings specific to sequence generation.
- `model.saftensors`: A file potentially containing model weights, but the specific format and use might be unique to the training framework used.
- `special_tokens_map.json`: Maps special tokens to their purpose within the tokenizer.
- `spiece.model`: The SentencePiece model file used by the tokenizer for subword segmentation.
- `tokenizer_config.json`: Configuration for the tokenizer.

These files collectively represent a saved state of the model at step 50, which can be used to resume training, perform inference, or analyze the model's behavior at this early stage.

For additional guidance on how to use these files with the Transformers library, refer to the Hugging Face documentation.
