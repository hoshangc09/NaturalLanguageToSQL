# Final Model Contents

This folder contains the final configuration and model files after the completion of training for the SQL Query Generation project. These files reflect the ultimate state of the model post the complete training cycle.

## Files Description

- `added_tokens.json`: Stores tokens added to the tokenizer's vocabulary during or after training.
- `config.json`: Includes the model's final configuration settings with optimized hyperparameters.
- `generation_config.json`: Details the settings for sequence generation, reflecting the final generation capabilities of the model.
- `model.safetensors`: Contains the final model weights and architecture information, encapsulating the learned patterns and behaviors.
- `special_tokens_map.json`: Maps special tokens to their functional role, essential for the tokenizer's operation.
- `spiece.model`: Represents the final state of the SentencePiece model utilized for processing text into tokens.
- `tokenizer_config.json`: The tokenizer's configuration outlining the rules and processes applied to incoming text data during tokenization.

The collective information in these files enables the model to be used for inference, further training, or analysis of its final learned behaviors.

For comprehensive usage instructions of these files with the Transformers library, please consult the Hugging Face documentation.
