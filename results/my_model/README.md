# My Model Contents

This folder houses the configuration and model files for a particular version of the SQL Query Generation model, referred to as `my_model`. It captures a significant stage in the model's training or a variant with specific adjustments.

## Files Description

- `config.json`: Contains the settings and hyperparameters that define the model's structure and behavior during this phase of training or execution.
- `generation_config.json`: Specifies the settings for the model's sequence generation capabilities, which guide how the model generates SQL queries from natural language input.
- `model.safetensors`: This is the binary file that contains the model's weights as of this stage or variant, encapsulating the learned parameters and the model's predictive power.

These files represent a snapshot of the model at a particular point in its development or a custom variant designed for specific scenarios. They enable the model to be utilized for inference, continued training, or as a foundation for further experimentation and development.

Consult the Hugging Face documentation for detailed instructions on employing these files within the Transformers library framework.
