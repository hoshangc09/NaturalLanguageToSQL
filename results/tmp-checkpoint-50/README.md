# Temporary Checkpoint-50 Contents

This folder encapsulates an interim set of files from the SQL Query Generation model, marking a temporary snapshot at checkpoint 50 during the model training process.

## Files Description

- `added_tokens.json`: Contains tokens added to the tokenizer during this stage of model training.
- `config.json`: Configuration settings of the model which include its structural parameters and hyperparameters.
- `generation_config.json`: Settings related to the generation of SQL queries, dictating how the model predicts outputs.
- `model.safetensors`: A binary file containing the trained parameters of the model, such as weights and biases.
- `optimizer.pt`: Stores the state of the optimizer, essential for resuming training with consistent momentum and variance.
- `rng_state.pth`: Captures the state of the random number generator to ensure training reproducibility.
- `scheduler.pt`: Reflects the state of the learning rate scheduler, critical for managing the learning rate policy during training.
- `special_tokens_map.json`: Maps the special tokens used by the tokenizer to their functions.
- `spiece.model`: The SentencePiece model file, enabling subword tokenization necessary for model inputs.
- `tokenizer_config.json`: Configuration details for the tokenizer.
- `trainer_state.json`: Information about the state of the training process.
- `training_args.bin`: Serialized training arguments capturing the command-line arguments used to run the training script.

Together, these files represent a comprehensive checkpoint that can be used to restart training from the same point, ensuring consistency across training sessions.

For directions on how to apply these files with the Transformers library for continued training or inference, consult the Hugging Face documentation.
